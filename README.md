Hi GitHub, I'm Emily Robles. I received my Bachelor of Environmental Sciences and Master of Information and Data Science degrees from UC Berkeley and now focus my research on challenges related to the use, sharing, and integration of diverse data types. 

I support data-to-model pipelines within the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) Tropics project as the data archive manager. On the Environmental System Science Data Infrastructure for a Virtual Ecosystem (ESS-DIVE) project, I've designed and implemented efficient workflows for data publication with the motivation of increasing data quality in the environmental science area. I also working on promoting and expanding the adoption of standard methods of formatting data to enable advanced search and integration. 
I believe that effective data management and integration are key to leveraging cutting edge science and unlocking the potential of environmental science data and enabling informed decision-making. You can learn more about my research [here](https://profiles.lbl.gov/40072-emily-robles).

Beyond my career, I've developed a passion for data science through my Master's degree in Information and Data Sciences. I am particularly proud of my thesis project, which applies influence maximization algorithms with fairness as a constraint to combat polarization on social media in a political use case. You can [check out the project website](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/fairimpact/home?authuser=1) for more information.
