Hi GitHub, I'm Emily Robles. I received my Bachelor of Environmental Sciences and Master of Information and Data Science degrees from UC Berkeley and now focus my research on challenges related to the use, sharing, and integration of diverse data types. I'm currently a part of data teams for two Department of Energy funded projects at the Lawrence berkeley National Laboratory.

üçÉ I support data-to-model pipelines within the [Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) Tropics](https://ngee-tropics.lbl.gov/) project as the data archive manager. I curate and analyze diverse data collected from tropical ecosystems around the world - it's really cool!

üî¨ On the Environmental System Science Data Infrastructure for a Virtual Ecosystem (ESS-DIVE) project, I've designed and implemented efficient workflows for data publication with the motivation of increasing the usability of open data in the environmental sciences. I work on creating and promoting the adoption of standard methods of formatting data to enable advanced search and integration and have been exploring the use of Natural Language Processing for enhancing scientific workflows. You can check out our (over 900!) publicly available datasets [here](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/).

I believe that effective data management and integration are key to leveraging cutting edge science and unlocking the potential of environmental science data to enable informed decision-making. You can learn more about my research [here](https://profiles.lbl.gov/40072-emily-robles) or take a look at my publications and conference presentations on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CsUlaTYAAAAJ&hl=en).

Beyond my career, I've developed a passion for data science through my Master's degree in Information and Data Sciences. I am particularly proud of my thesis project, which applies influence maximization algorithms with fairness as a constraint to combat polarization on social media in a political use case. Feel free to [check out the project website](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/fairimpact/home?authuser=1) for more information.
