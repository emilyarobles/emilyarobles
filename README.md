Hi! I'm Emily Robles. My work with the ESS-DIVE data repository focuses on publishing datasets with high quality metadata for the Department of Energy BER program's Earth System Science projects. As a member of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments Tropics project's data team, I help manage the project archive and create efficient data to model pipelines.
