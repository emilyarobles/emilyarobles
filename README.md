Hi! My name is Emily Robles. I'm an Environmental Data Science Research Associate at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My work with the ESS-DIVE data repository focuses on publishing datasets with high quality metadata for the Department of Energy BER program's Earth System Science projects. 
As a member of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments Tropics project's data team, I help manage the project archive and create efficient data to model pipelines. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in improving the usability and longevity of Environmental science data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to improve and facilitate the use of data to model pipelines.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through email at emilyarobles@lbl.gov
