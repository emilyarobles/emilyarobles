Hi GitHub, I'm Emily Robles. I received my Bachelor of Environmental Sciences and Master of Information and Data Science degrees from UC Berkeley and now focus my research on challenges related to the use, sharing, and integration of diverse data types. I'm currently a part of data teams for two Department of Energy funded projects at the Lawrence berkeley National Laboratory.
